## MVP Model Description


The goal is to classify images of galaxies from their morphology. Galaxies will be classified into either Spiral or Elliptical. The model that will be used in this project is a Convolutional Neural Network since image data will be used to classify the galaxies. Train, validation, and test will take place during trainig, and I will use PyTorch to build the network.
