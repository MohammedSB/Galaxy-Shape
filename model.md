## MVP Model Description


The goal is to classify images of galaxies from their morphology into either Elliptical or Spiral. The model that will be used in this project is a Convolutional Neural Network since image data will be used to classify the galaxies. Train, validation, and test will take place during trainig, and I will use PyTorch to build the network.
